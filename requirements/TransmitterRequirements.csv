Index,Id,Type,Summary,Description,Rationale
1,TransmitterConfigurableParameters,Container,Requirements for the configurable transmitter parameters.,"The transmitter should allow the user to modify the carrier frequency, upsampling rate, and upsampling method used to transmit the signal.",To allow the user to configure the transmitter parameters when transmitting the signal.
1.1,UserConfigurableCarrierFrequency,Functional,The carrier frequency should be configurable by the user.,"The transmitter should allow the user to modify the carrier frequency property.",To allow the user to configure the carrier frequency of the transmitter.
1.2,UserConfigurableUpsamplingRate,Functional,The upsampling rate should be configurable by the user.,"The transmitter should allow the user to modify the upsampling rate property.",To allow the user to configure the upsampling rate of the transmitter.
1.3,UserConfigurableUpsamplingMethod,Functional,The upsampling method should be configurable by the user.,"The transmitter should allow the user to modify the upsampling method property.",To allow the user to configure the upsampling method of the transmitter.
2,TransmitterConstruction,Functional,Construction requirements for the transmitter.,"The transmitter class should allow the user to construct a transmitter object by specifying name-value pairs for all configurable properties.",To provide a convenient and user-friendly API for constructing a transmitter.
3,Transmission,Functional,The transmitter should provide a means of transmission.,"The transmitter should provide a means for the user to enter a signal for transmission. The input signal should be modulated for transmission and returned in a timetable along with its corresponding time vector.",To provide a convenient and user-friendly API for the user to transmit their signal.
